# Specification Quality Checklist: Mock Movie Data for Local Development

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-01-31  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for planning phase
- All 6 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
- Success criteria focus on developer experience metrics (onboarding time, zero config)
- Edge cases covered: zero reviews, long titles, grade distribution
- Scope clearly excludes authentication and admin features
- Risk mitigation strategies documented for image service dependencies
